//Sample code from 
//https://github.com/shuyo/iir/blob/master/ngram/rnnlm.py

Usage:
1. Prepare training data (don't need the pretrain bash, here use re.sub instead)
     > cat ./Holmes_Training_Data/*.TXT > training.txt
2. Create dictionary & training 
     > python rnnlm.py -f training.txt

Note:
 You have better install blas with numpy (ex. Openblas).
 Although it can only train on CPU, with blas (multi-thread) support the  
 training can be faster.
 The environment is setted on Media 3,9,10 with 16~24 CPU cores support.  

ToDo: 
 Do testing
 ReWrite the code
