//Sample code from 
//https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/theano-users/rnnlm/theano-users/7ieosNfL_AI/6XjiG94PhjkJ

Usage:
1. Train on random generated training data
     > THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=cpu,floatX=float32 python rnn.py
     > THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=gpu,floatX=float32 python rnn_gpu.py
     (there is no significant different between cpu & gpu version)

Note:
 You have better read the document about "theano.scan()"
 changing "truncate_gradient" can modify BPTT unfold step.

ToDo: 
 1 to N gram input (or directly combine with the other code)
